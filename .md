# Hello Lab

<P>Today we will start our hacking journey by familiarizing in the hacking fields. We will start by downloading Linux in to our computer. On Teros site we can see a short introduction to downloading Debian Live ISOinto the Oracle VIrtual Box. Hacking is better on Linux for multiple
reasons. On the Teros sites we will learn new Linux commmands, to use in hacking and penetration testing. Linux provides better network manipulation than Windows. Linux is also open sourced so it allows you to use your freedom and customize the whole learning
process according to your needs. We will be downloading a VM (Virtual Machine) so the penetration testing is much more safer.</P>

## Cant Fish

<p>The main goal of this task was to shutdown the network in the terminal, and then test if the network is shutdown, by trying to send a ping.
Firstly i tried to find a command which would shut the networks off. In the Ask Ubuntu page i found someone starting a conversation of the best
way to turn off/on the network completly. Here i found someone commenting a command nmcli networking off. I  tried it and after i tried it
on the right, there popped up a tab saying "The connection has been disconnected" and then i knew it worked. After this i tried the pinging method fromm Teros website
which was ping 1.1.1.1 and when i tried it, the system said "ping: connect: Network is unreachable". Everything worked well and the task was interesting to me, 
because you can easily turn off the network with a single command and i did not know that.</p>

## Local Only

<p>Next up we will try to portscan our own computer using localhost address. We can only portscan our own computer, because portscanning
other computers is illegal. Scanning is not illegal. You’re thinking of “unlawful access” or smth like that, which is how hacking is prosecuted in the US. 
If you see an open port and then proceed to access data through it, that’s when it becomes a crime, depending on whether that access is intended or not
(UnintelligentSlime, Reddit, 2024). So firstly i started by downloading the nmap into our Linux. The reason is that according to Red Hat Blog, you can 
check localhost scan through the nmap. Then i updated the packages in the respitory with sudo apt update, and then i installed the nmap with sudo apt-get install 
nmap. After nmap is installed we will start by disconnecting from the network again with using the same command as in the last task.
Next up i used the command nmap localhost which then scanned the host for me. The scan showed me basically what ports were open and what were closed.
In my computer there were 999 closed tcp ports. To understand what ports are you have to think of them as numbers that identify services or applications.
For example SSH default port is 22 (SSH, 2025). If the port is open, then that means it tries to find an connection and is usable. Open ports can be manipulated
by hackers. In my system there was 631 tcp port open. The 631 tcp port is IPP, which is short for Internet Printing Protocol (HP, 2025) After scanning everything i just connected to the network again.</p>

## Daemon

<p>Next we will try the same thing but now with a Daemon installed. A daemon is just a name given to any program that is running in the background to either do something or to provide a service (for other programs to "do something" with). To put it in "real life" terms, think of things like a FitBit or other health tracker thing as a daemon. Fitbits are "programs" that are "continuously running in the background" and what they do is track your biometrics. You don't use them in the sense of "let me use google to find something out" but you use them in the sense of "i want to know my heart rate at all times, so i'll use a fitbit." (sixdirections, Reddit, 2024) We will start by 
using the commands form Teros website, which are sudo apt-get update which updates the packages and sudo apt-get -y install apache2 to install the daemon. After installing
we disconnect from the network again with nmcli networking off. I used the same command for scanning the port nmap localhost and noticed that now there were not 999
closed tcp ports, but actually 998 closed so one less. There was the 80 tcp port open, which is the HTTP port and HTTP is used for web traffic and exchanging data between websites (NordVPN, 2025). So the main difference that i noticed, was that the Daemon opens an extra port and im pretty sure you can choose how many ports you want to
open with the Daemon activated, which then opens up new entry points for attackers. In the end i disabled the daemon with sudo command and also reconnected to the
network.</p>
